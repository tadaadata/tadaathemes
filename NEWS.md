# tadaathemes 0.0.1

* Add `theme_ipsum_ss`, a `hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum()` derivative using the `Source Sans Pro` font family, which is also (partially) included in `inst/fonts/source-sans-pro`. The font family name is "Source Sans 3" for some, though.
* Add colors and scale functions for `theme_trakt`.
* Bundle fonts Source Sans Pro and Lato (experimentally). The latter is used in `theme_trakt()`.
* Add WIP implementation of `theme_trakt()`
* Add font loading mechanism akin to `hrbrthemes` to startup (adds `extrafont` dependency).
* Add `vignette("tadaa-themes")` to display all implemented themes with example plot. More plots to come to show different `geom`s.
* Add `theme_tadaa()`
* Add `theme_tadaark()`
* Add `theme_readthedown()` from `tadaatoolbox` as a starter.
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
