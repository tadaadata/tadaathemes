# tadaathemes 0.0.1

* Bundle fonts Source Sans Pro and Lato (experimentally). The latter is used in `theme_trakt()`.
* Add WIP implementation of `theme_trakt()`
* Add font loading mechanism akin to `hrbrthemes` to startup (adds `extrafont` dependency).
* Add `vignette("tadaa-themes")` to display all implemented themes with example plot. More plots to come to show different `geom`s.
* Add `theme_tadaa()`
* Add `theme_tadaark()`
* Add `theme_readthedown()` from `tadaatoolbox` as a starter.
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
